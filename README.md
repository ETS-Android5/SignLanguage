# SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION (prototype)
### APP FOR INTERPRETING TO AND FROM SIGN LANGUAGE

The app uses a deep learning model developed by a team of volunteers from PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook, hosted by Udacity.

https://github.com/coalaroot/Pytorch-challenge-side-project/tree/develop

The model is trained on data from
https://www.kaggle.com/kumawatmanish/deep-learning-sign-language-dataset/data
and data collected by volunteers.

This page will automatically detect your operating system. Accept the terms and conditions to start the download. Double-click the downloaded file and follow all the prompts. After finishing the install, the Setup Wizard will download and install some additional components. Be patient, this might take some time depending on your internet speed.
 
3. At the start up screen of Android Studio, click Check Out project from Version Control, pick GIT and paste GitHub URL for the project https://github.com/forfireonly/SignLanguage .

4. Connect your phone to your computer with a USB cable. If you're using Windows, you might need to install the appropriate USB driver for your device.

5. Enable USB debugging in the Developer options as following. First, you must enable the developer options:
